Quadrant in which the given co-ordinate lie in Python
Here, in this page we will discuss the program to find the quadrant in which the given co-ordinate lie in python . From the origin at x = 0 and y = 0, a pointy can move in four different directions. There are 4 coordinates available when we think in 2-Dimension. These 2-dimensions are at X-axis and Y-axis. Now based on their positive or negative nature this axis shows 4 different quadrants. This 4-Quadrants are different and are as follows.
