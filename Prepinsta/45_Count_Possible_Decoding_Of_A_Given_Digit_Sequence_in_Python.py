Count Possible Decoding Of A Given Digit Sequence in Python
Here we will discuss how to count all the possible decoding of a given digit sequence in Python. Before counting the number of decoding’s first let’s see how the numbers are assumed to be coded. The decoding programs are the most possible questions asked and are largely practiced in Python programming. The program counts the number of possible decoding’s of the entered digit by the user of the given sequence.
