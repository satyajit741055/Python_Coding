Merge Intervals
On this page we will learn to create a Python Program to Merge Intervals.
In this problem we have to merge all possible overlapping intervals and print them.
Input : [ [1, 3], [2, 6], [8, 10], [15, 18], [18, 20] ]
Output : [ [1, 6], [8, 10], [15, 20] ]
Explanation : In this [1,3] and [2,6] are overlapping so we’ll merge then and replace with [1,6]. [8,10] will remain same as it is not overlapping with any interval. Again as we can see [15,18] is overlapping with [18,20] there for it will be replaced by [15,20].
