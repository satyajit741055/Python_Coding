Trapping Rain Water in Python
Here, in this page we  will discuss one of the famous problem of  Trapping Rain Water in Python . We are given with n non-negative integers representing an elevation map where the width of each bar is 1, we need to compute how much water it is able to trap after raining.
Example :
Input : arr = [2,0,3,0,2,0,4]
Output : 9
Explanation : We can trap “2 units” of water between 2 and 3, “7 units” between 3 and 4 (“3 units” between 3 and 2 , “1 unit” on top of bar 2 and “3 units” between 2 and 4.
