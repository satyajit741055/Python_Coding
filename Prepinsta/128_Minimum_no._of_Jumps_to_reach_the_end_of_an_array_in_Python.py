Minimum no. of Jumps to reach the end of an array in Python
On this page we will learn to create Minimum no. of Jumps to reach the end of an array in Python language. If not possible print -1.
Example:-
Input: arr = [1, 3, 5, 8, 9, 2, 6, 7, 6, 8, 9]
Output: 3 (1-> 3 -> 9 -> 9)
Explanation: Jump from 1st element to 2nd element as there is only 1 step, now there are three options 5, 8 or 9. If 8 or 9 is chosen then the end node 9 can be reached. So 3 jumps are required.
