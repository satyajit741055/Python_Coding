Check the balance of parenthesis in Python
To check balanced parenthesis is a basic interview question where we are asked to find whether the given string(of brackets) is balanced or not. To do this , the traditional way of doing is using stacks but we can also find by using normal programming techniques. Different brackets are  ( ) , [ ] , { }. Question can be asked on any type of bracket or of all types of brackets.
