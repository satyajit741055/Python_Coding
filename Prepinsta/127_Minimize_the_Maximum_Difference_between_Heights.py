Minimize the Maximum Difference between Heights
In this we need to either increase or decrease the height of every tower by k (only once) where k > 0. The task is Python Program to Minimize the Maximum Difference between Heights of the longest and the shortest tower after modifications print out this difference.
Input : arr = [2, 16, 9], k = 6
Output : Maximum difference is 5.
Explanation : We change 2 to 8, 16 to 10 and 9 to 15. Maximum difference is 7
(between 8 and 15). We can’t get a lower difference.
