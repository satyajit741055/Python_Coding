HCF of a Number using Recursion
on this page we will learn to create a python program to find HCF of a Number using Recursion.
HCF – Highest common factor of two or more number such that it can completely divide all the numbers.
Example :
Input : first = 23, second = 69
Output : HCF of 23 and 69 is 23
Explanation : No other number in greater then 23 can divide both 23 and 69 completely. That’s why 23 is HCF of 23 & 69
