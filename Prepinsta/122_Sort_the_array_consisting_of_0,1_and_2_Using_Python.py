Sort the array consisting of 0,1 and 2 Using Python
In this article we will see a Python Program to sort the given array which consist of 0,1,2. User will enter elements of array which is either 0,1 or 2. We have to sort that array consisting o,1 and 2 but without using sorting algorithm. We will use count function to count different elements and then arrange them.
Example:-
Array: 1 2 0 2 1 0 2 1 0 2 0 1
Array after sorting: 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 2 2 2 2
