Smallest Sub-array with sum greater than a given value in Python
Here, on this page, we will discuss the program to find Smallest Sub-array with sum greater than a given value in Python programming language. We are given an unsorted array containing non-negative integers we need to find a continuous sub-array of minimum length whose sum is greater than the given sum
Example :
Input : arr : [ 1, 4, 0, 0, 2, 6, 3 ] & sum = 6
Output : Sub-array with sum greater than 6 will have a size of 2 Elements
Explanation : For the given array. The sub-array from index 4 to 5 will give a sum of 8 (2+6), greater than the value  6, and the smallest subarray with a sum greater than the given sum.
