LCM of a Number using Recursion
On this page we will learn to create a python program to find LCM of a Number using Recursion.
LCM – Lowest common multiple of two or more number. Is Smallest number that it is completely divisible by all the numbers for which we are finding LCM. 
Example :
Input : first = 23, second = 69
Output : HCF of 23 and 69 is 69
Explanation : No other number less then 69 can be divide by both 23 and 69 completely. That’s why 69 is LCM of 23 & 69
