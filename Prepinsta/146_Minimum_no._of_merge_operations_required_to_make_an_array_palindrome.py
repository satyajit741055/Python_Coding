Minimum no. of merge operations required to make an array palindrome
Here on this page, we will learn how to Minimum no. of merge operations required to make an array palindrome in Python Programming Language.
Example :
Input : array = [2, 10, 12, 26, 3, 22, 2]
Output : 2
Explanation : We need to merge 10 and 22 so, the array will become [2, 22, 26, 3, 22, 2]. Again we will merge 26 and 3 so the array becomes [2, 22, 29, 22, 2]. Now, the array becomes palindromic, hence we need to do 2 merging operations to make the given array palindromic.
