Array Rotation Left and Right
In this program we’ll be learning about Python program for rotation of elements of array – left and right to a specified number of times. An array is said to be right rotated if all the selected elements were  moved towards right by one position. The last element of array will become the first element of array after rotation and vice versa for left rotation.
