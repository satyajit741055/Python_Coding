Find Non Repeating Characters
The string is a combination of characters when 2 or more characters join together it forms string whether the formation gives a meaningful or meaningless output. In python programming, we treat a single character also as a string because there is no datatype as a character in python. In this python program, we will find unique elements or non repeating elements of the string.
