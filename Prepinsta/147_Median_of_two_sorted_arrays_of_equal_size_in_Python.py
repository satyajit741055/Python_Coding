Median of two sorted arrays of equal size in Python
Here, on this page, we will discuss the program to find the Median of two sorted arrays of equal size in the Python programming language. We are given two arrays say arr1[ ] and arr2[ ] of the same size say n. We need to find the median after merging these arrays.
Example :
Input : arr1 = [ 1, 12, 15, 26, 38 ],  arr2 = [ 2, 13, 17, 30, 45 ]
Output : 16
Explanation : After merging and sorting the array it will be [ 1, 2, 12, 13, 15, 17, 26, 30, 38, 45 ], middle elements are 15 and 17 so, median of the given array will be ((15+17)/2) = 16
