Count The Common Subsequence in two Strings
In this article, we will learn how to write a python program to count common subsequence in two strings. We will have two strings n and m.
Lets understand with the help of example.
m= “ABC”
n= “AB”
The subsequence of m = A,B,C, AB, BC, AC, ABC  and n=A,B,AB
The count of common subsequences is 3 that is (A,B AB)
